        Philip Bladon spent the first 15 years of his career in the UK’s deep coal mining industry, working on the coal face from the age of 18.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concurrently, he studied and qualified as a Chartered Mining Engineer, and also hold the 1st Class Certificate of Competency; the UK Mine Manager’s statutory qualification.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the demise of the deep coal mining industry in the UK, he held Safety Management positions in general industry before joining the insurance sector as a Liability Risk Surveyor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he cut his teeth on what is now his core expertise; a client-facing role providing Casualty Risk Management solutions, specialising in Employers, Public and Products Liability, together with Contractors Risks and Environmental Impairment Liability risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        During his time at one of the UK's leading Insurers, Phil headed up the Specialist Casualty Risk Engineering Team, managing a £400m Portfolio, with clients from across all industrial sectors, and which achieved market-beating Loss Ratios as well as its best-ever Return On Equity result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now with over 25 years’ experience in his chosen specialist field, Phil provides an independent service to Insurers, Brokers and Policyholders alike, helping each to mitigate the risk of the incidents that typically lead to claims, whilst concurrently enhancing their claims defensibility mechanisms, and so improving their bottom lines in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phil is a European Engineer, a Chartered Mining Engineer, a Member of the Institution of Materials, Minerals & Mining, a Chartered Member of the Institution of Occupational Safety & Health, and a Chartered Safety Practitioner.
