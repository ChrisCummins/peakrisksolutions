Ever wondered why liability claims can succeed even though your company hasn’t been prosecuted?

Using our remote-based outsourced solutions, we’ll complement your existing internal capabilities principally to reduce your risk of incidents, but also so that if things do go wrong, your systems are geared to rebuff claims where it's appropriate to do so, but also to minimise the overall costs of claims in the process.

**The beauty of this service is in its scalability and efficiency.**

With hourly rates and no minimum fee, you maintain full control over the level and cost of the support you require, meaning you have liability expertise readily on tap, wherever you are in the world, but only as and when you need it.

Working directly for you, and if you prefer, in conjunction with your Broker, Insurer, nominated Solicitor, or other Partner Provider, we offer specialist Risk Control support in the following areas:

* Employers Liability/Workers’ Compensation, Products Liability, Public Liability, Contractors Liability and Environmental Impairment Liability exposures
* For UK-domiciled Liability policies and International Casualty policies
* Claims Defensibility Solutions including:
