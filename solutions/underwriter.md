**The days of sending a surveyor to site and getting a 40-page report that no-one reads, are all but over.**

**Use smarter methods to improve your Risk Intelligence, Risk Improvement and Client-Retention strategies**

Suitable for any Casualty line, our Underwriting Risk Control services will resonate with underwriters who seek some degree of independently-derived reassurance, particularly in respect of:

* Products & Public Liability, Employers Liability/Workers’ Comp, and Contractors Liability exposures
* International Casualty risks
* UK domiciled Casualty risks
* Specific risk profile concerns, or more general insight into the policyholder’s control of risk
* Ad Hoc instructions; eg, one-off assessment of a specific underwriting concern 
* Longer-term support; ongoing risk control input, including client-relationship management
* Retained Risk Control support and advice

Using our remote-based outsourced services, with hourly rates and no minimum fee, you can now instantly access an efficient and highly cost-effective means of augmenting your existing risk evaluation processes.

**The beauty of this service is in its scalability and efficiency.**

At one end of the scale, it’s now a simple email or phone call to get the expert’s view on a particular element of a client’s risk profile.  

We’ll tell you how well that exposure is currently being managed and, where it’s necessary, steer you on what more should be done to improve the risk.

Where you want more input, we’ll make direct, remote contact with the client through web-based meetings to get you that fuller insight you need.

In exceptional cases and only where it’s your preference, a conventional site survey can still be arranged.

When it comes to feedback though, the days of reading a 40 page surveyor’s report are thankfully long gone.

Whichever level of support you select, the feedback you get will be in the format of your choice, ranging from an informal telephone conversation, or email with key action points, videoed web-based meetings, all the way through to a comprehensive but focussed, formal report document.

Whatever you prefer is agreed up front, so that at all times you’re only paying for the service that you value, but also at a cost that you control.
