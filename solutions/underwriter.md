**The days of sending a surveyor to site and getting a 40-page report that no-one reads, are all but over.**

**Use smarter methods to improve your Risk Intelligence, Risk Improvement and Client-Retention strategies**

Suitable for any Casualty line, our Underwriting Risk Control services will resonate with underwriters who seek some degree of independently-derived reassurance, particularly in respect of:

* Products & Public Liability, Employers Liability/Workers’ Comp, and Contractors Liability exposures
* International Casualty risks
* UK domiciled Casualty risks
* Specific risk profile concerns, or more general insight into the policyholder’s control of risk
* Ad Hoc instructions; eg, one-off assessment of a specific underwriting concern 
* Longer-term support; ongoing risk control input, including client-relationship management
* Retained Risk Control support and advice

Using our remote-based outsourced services, with hourly rates and no minimum fee, you can now instantly access an efficient and highly cost-effective means of augmenting your existing risk evaluation processes.

**The principal advantages to you are Cost-Efficiencies and Scalability.**

At one end of the scale, it’s now a simple email or phone call to get the expert’s view on a particular element of a client’s risk profile.  

We’ll tell you how well that exposure is currently being managed and, where it’s necessary, steer you on what more should be done to improve the risk.

When you need a deeper understanding of how risk is being controlled, we’ll use remote means, such as web-based meetings with your client, to provide you with that more-comprehensive assessment.

In exceptional cases and only where it’s your preference, a conventional site survey can still be arranged.

When it comes to feeding back our findings, you also dictate the level of support you need. 

Whether that's only an informal telephone conversation, or an email with key action points, videoed web-meeting, or a comprehensive formal report document, our feedback to you will always be as succinct and focussed as you need it to be.

Whatever you prefer is agreed up front, so that at all times you’re only paying for the service that you value, but also at a cost that you control.
